APPLE,Impact of Tariffs on US Tech Companies: A 10-Year Analysis (2015-2025),"After spending weeks analyzing the impact of tariff policies on US tech companies over the past decade, I wanted to share my findings with this community. I've been fascinated by how trade policies affect different segments of the tech industry, and the results were quite surprising.

**Methodology**

I analyzed stock performance of major US tech companies around 27 significant tariff events from 2016-2025, comparing hardware vs. software companies and measuring against the S&P 500. I used daily returns data and calculated average impacts in the 60-day window following each tariff announcement.

**Overall Impact**

* Tech sector showed slightly better resilience than the broader market, with an average daily return of 0.03% following tariff events compared to 0.02% for the S&P 500
* Hardware companies (0.08% avg. daily return) significantly outperformed software companies (0.02%) following tariff announcements - contrary to what I initially expected!

**Most Affected Companies**

* **Negatively impacted:** AKAM (-0.17%), EPAM (-0.14%), WDC (-0.09%)
* **Positively impacted:** ADI (0.20%), TXN (0.17%), AAPL (0.16%)

What's particularly interesting is that hardware companies, which I assumed would be more vulnerable to tariffs due to their supply chain exposure, actually showed more resilience on average. This might suggest that investors expect hardware companies to benefit from protectionist policies in the long run, **or that these companies have more pricing power to pass costs onto consumers**.

The pricing power phenomenon is especially evident with companies like Apple, which maintained strong performance despite tariff pressures. Their brand loyalty and premium positioning allow them to absorb or pass on increased costs without significantly impacting demand. Hardware companies with established market dominance seem to use their pricing power as an effective buffer against tariff-induced cost increases, turning what should be a negative into a potential advantage over smaller competitors who can't as easily pass costs forward.

The most significant tariff events were Trump's initial 45% tariff proposal (2016), the solar panels and washing machines tariffs (2018), and the more recent universal tariffs proposal (2025). Each of these created noticeable volatility in the tech sector.

I was also surprised to see that some of the most negatively affected companies weren't necessarily the ones with the highest international exposure. AKAM and EPAM took significant hits despite not being traditional hardware manufacturers.

What do you all think about these findings? Has anyone else observed similar patterns or have alternative explanations for why hardware companies might be outperforming software companies in response to tariff announcements?
